## Predicting Boston housing price

#### Objective : Predict Boston Housing Prices using Pytorch

**Dataset** : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing

This dataset concerns housing values in suburbs of Boston. There is **506 instances** of **14 attributes** each in the dataset. Generally, this dataset is suitable for regression task. Attributes in the datasets:

- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town.
- **ZN**: Proportion of residental land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
- **NOX**: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres.
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
- **TAX**: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
- **PTRATIO**: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
- **B**: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
- **LSTAT**: % lower status of the population.
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000â€™s (usually the target).

**Description** :  *Boston housing price contain 13 Variables and one target variable which we have trained using **pytorch model** and **sklearn linear model** and we got same accuracy around **78**%.*
